            I was in mumbai for a week at my sister`s place. I was bored and wanted to visit some places.
            I asked my sister to suggest some places.
            She suggested me to visit some temples in mumbai.
            I visited two temples in mumbai. I will share my experience with you.

            <p><em>local information : </em>Siddhivinayak temple located in titwala, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India is one
                of the ancient Hindu temples. Siddhivinayak temple boasts from the period of Mahabharata, with
                magnificent architecture style. This temple is popularly known as “Titwala Ganesh” and is flooded with
                devotees on Tuesdays and Chaturthis.</p>

            <div class="exp">
                <span>My experience :-</span> <br>
                <p>I traveled to the Mahaganapati location from Asangoa, Mumbai via local train. I thought I had
                    mastered traveling through the Mumbai local trains.</p>

                <p>I got on a local train to Titwala. At first, there was no crowd, but as the stations passed by, the
                    crowd increased. I feared missing my stop, so I made my way through the crowd and stood near the
                    door, waiting for Titwala station. I wanted to leave the doorway, but people kept pushing back as
                    they rushed to board the train. I was confident that I would handle it just like any Mumbaikar, but
                    as the train neared the station and I saw the overwhelming crowd, I hesitated.</p>

                <p>I tried to step out, but I was unsuccessful. Unfortunately, my sandal got stuck on my foot thumb, and
                    I fell onto the platform at Titwala station. The public around me started shouting, "Oh no!" but it
                    wasn't a big deal—I had just fallen and wasn't hurt. However, I did learn a lesson: never try to act
                    unnecessarily overconfident. I quickly got off the station to avoid the embarrassment of failing to
                    exit the train properly.</p>

                <p>Right in front of Platform No. 1, there is an auto-rickshaw stand where you can get a ride to the
                    Ganapati Mandir. I asked for the Ganapati Mandir and got onto the front half-seat near the driver,
                    as all autos are shared. The ride took about 10-15 minutes and cost only ₹15.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching the location, the heat was intense, so I stopped at a sugarcane juice stall and had a
                    glass of fresh juice, which cost me ₹20. Then, I headed towards the temple. There were many stalls
                    nearby selling essential items for the puja. One uncle was eagerly persuading everyone, including
                    me, to buy "Harali," Ganapati Bappa’s favorite offering.</p>

                <p>The temple had a long queue structure, but I was lucky as there were only a few people at that time.
                    I walked straight towards the main temple. Photography is not allowed inside, but the Ganapati Bappa
                    idol is very attractive and brings a sense of calm. In front of the temple, there is a "Ghabhara,"
                    where people sit, meditate, or pray while admiring Ganapati Bappa.</p>

                <p>Outside the main temple, there are stalls selling prasad and other offerings. I would suggest buying
                    the laddus from these shops—they are very tasty. Near the Ganapati Mandir, there is a beautiful
                    garden with a serene lake, which is worth visiting. You can sit there and relax for free. However, I
                    would advise against going too deep into the garden, as many couples occupy the secluded areas.</p>

                <p>After exploring the garden, my mom told me to eat something. I decided to have vada pav. A lady at a
                    corner stall eagerly called out to me, so I ordered one vada pav. However, the price was
                    surprisingly high—₹18, which was even more than the auto fare! Still, I ordered and ate it. After
                    that, I took an auto back to Titwala station, which again cost me ₹15.</p>

                <p>And that’s how my Titwala Ganapati Mandir trip ended.</p>
